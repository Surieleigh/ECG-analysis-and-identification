ECG-analysis-and-identification
===============================
Topic I: ECG(Electrocardiogram)measurement and analysis

Objective: To conduct an ECG measurement and identify the following feature points (P,QRS, T waves) of the obtained ECG

Description: In this experiment, the ECG from both a subject and the Patient Simulator are acquired by using the PowerLab

in the Biomedical Engineering Laboratory. After obtaining the ECGs, a program (written either in Matlab or other

software/languages)should be prepared for analyzing the obtained ECGs’ points.

Requirements:

1. The spectral of each recorded ECG(atleast 120seconds each)should be shown

2. The feature points (P, QRS, T waves) of the ECGs should be identified automatically by yoursoftware program

3. The beat rate & R‐R interval of the ECGs should be calculated automatically by the software
